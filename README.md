- 👋 Hi, I’m @goCORA
- 👀 I’m interested in Quantum Safe Cryptography.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about GitHub.
- 💞️ I am currently:
1) Improving the CORA API.
2) Using the CORA API to launch CORA-X LIte.
3) Working with 3rd parties to implement the CORA-API in social media platform in which users maintain control of their online, digital footprint.

- CORA is a step beyond encryption. CORA is an acronym for Context Ordered Replacement Algorithm. CORA is Quantum safe, 
meaning that Quantum computers will not break CORA's encryption. 
This is mostly due to the fact that CORA is not factorization based, but rather, CORA is probabilistic in nature, requiring an unimaginably large number of attempts to break (brute force alone). 
Additionally CORA is a distributed technology; each encryption results in 2-40 CORA blocs (binary localized obfuscated containers).
- 📫 If you would like to know more about CORA, or would like to collaborate on CORA-Gold (cryptocurrency), visit https://CORAcsi.com or https://CORA-Gold.com) and select 'Contact".
